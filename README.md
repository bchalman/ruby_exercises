# H2 A Few Ruby Exercises:

- **caesar_cipher** - A method that takes a string and a shift factor, then outputs the modified string.
- **stock_picker** - A method that takes an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. Returns a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell.
- **substrings** - A method that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings as the second argument. Returns a hash listing each substring that was found in the original string, and how many times it was found.
